      <p>My overall concept is dragons are cool! It's plain and simple.
        I simply want to share with the person on the other side of the screen my interest,
        by having them see a randomly generated drawing of a dragon
        as it begins to disappear, and have them trace it as fast as possible;
        and perhaps continue to draw it on their own so that they create their own dragons.</p>
      <p>I think I simply want people to have fun using my drawing machine. By giving them
        the chance to save their drawing at the end of the exercise, I guess they create art
        for themselves and perhaps a memory to share. But my main purpose is to make it fun
        and interesting to do rather than visually appealing.</p>
      <p>The images that I hope will be produced will be different than what my dragons
        actually look. My dragons were cut off in segments and are placed in a way that
        they seem incomplete, which gives the person doing the activity the freedom to
        interpret what the missing parts of the dragons might look like. So I think my
        drawing machine gives people the opportunity to learn to draw dragons and create their own.</P>
      <p>The main features of my drawing machine are as follows: Randomly generated dragon
        drawing, which will begin to disappear. Different color strokes to choose from,
        and the ability to draw lines on the canvas. The option to save the artwork at
        the end of the exercise, and to clear the canvas and restart the exercise.</p>
